# 2048 Game

## Overview

This project is a Python implementation of the popular 2048 game. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, where the player's objective is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the number 2048. The game continues until there are no more valid moves available.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The game includes a simple GUI built using Python's tkinter library, allowing users to play the game interactively.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Players can use arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move tiles in the corresponding direction.
- **Scoring**: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases as tiles are merged.
- **Win/Loss Detection**: The game detects when the player achieves the 2048 tile or when there are no more valid moves available, resulting in either a win or loss.
- **Restart Option**: Players have the option to restart the game after winning or losing.
